Inter thread - condition await()
await() - unlock lock wait until signalled
awaitNanos(nanosTimeout) - wait no longer than nanosTimeout
await(time, unit) - wait no longer than time in given time units
awaitUntil(date deadline) - wake up before the deadline date

condition signal - wake up a single thread waiting on the condition variable, if multiple are waiting only 1 is woken
A thread that wakes up needs to reacquire the lock associated with the condition variable so a signal needs to lock.unlock
If no thread is waiting on the condition var the signal method doesnt do anything

Condition signalAll - sends a broadcast signal to all threads waiting on condition variable.
doesnt need to know how many threads are waiting.
