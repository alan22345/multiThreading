The object class contains
wait()
notify()
notifyAll()
Every java class inherits from the object class
Use any object as a condition variable and a lock ( using the synchronized keyword)

wait() - current thread waits until another thread wakes it, thread doesnt consume CPU
notify() - wakes up a single thread waiting on object
notifyAll() - wakes all the threads waiting on object

To call any of the above we need to acquire the monitor of that object (use synchronized on that object) :)

EXAMPLE ---

class myClass {
boolean isComplete = false
waitUntilComplete(){
    synchronized(this) {
    while (isComplete = false) {
        this.wait();

public void complete() {
    synchronized(this) {
        isComplete = true;
        this.notify()  this wakes up the first thread
